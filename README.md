- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ben Morrison (@Bmorr1123)
- My programming journey began in 2017, and I've been programming regularly since!
- I started in Java, then learned Python, and I've used 10+ languages during college and internships. I am happy to learn more!
- Projects that automate or streamline processes are my favorite to work on. Saving time for myself and others is what gets me motivated.
- I am looking for a Software Engineering role now!
